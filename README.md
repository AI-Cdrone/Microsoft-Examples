## Introduction

The **IoT JumpWay** is an IoT platform that provides access to an **IoT PaaS** for **IoT communication**, **tutorials** and **examples** and a **social community** for **IoT developers** and **makers**. The platform provides the fundamental services that allow you to securely distribute data from IoT devices and manage and control them securely via applications.

The **IoT JumpWay Microsoft examples** provide example projects that you can use to get started using the **IoT JumpWay** for your **Microsoft** based IoT/AI projects.

# IoT JumpWay Microsoft Tutorials & Source code

Below you will find information about the main IoT JumpWay Microsoft projects. Click the graphics to be taken to the relevant tutorials/source codes:

## Intel AI DevJam Demo
