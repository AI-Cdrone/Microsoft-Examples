## Introduction

The **IoT JumpWay** is an IoT platform that provides access to an **IoT PaaS** for **IoT communication**, **tutorials** and **examples** and a **social community** for **IoT developers** and **makers**. The platform provides the fundamental services that allow you to securely distribute data from IoT devices and manage and control them securely via applications.

The **IoT JumpWay Microsoft examples** provide example projects that you can use to get started using the **IoT JumpWay** for your **Microsoft** based IoT/AI projects.

The  [Intel AI DevJam Demo](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC "Intel AI DevJam Demo") uses a **universal Windows application** to communicate with a **facial recognition classifier** and a classifier trained to detect **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (Breast cancer)** in **histology images**. The project combines the  [Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification Using Computer Vision & IoT](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/tree/master/Intel-Movidius/IDC-Classification "Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification Using Computer Vision & IoT") and [TASS Movidius Facenet Classifier](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Intel-Examples/tree/master/Intel-Movidius/TASS/Facenet "TASS Movidius Facenet Classifier") projects.
