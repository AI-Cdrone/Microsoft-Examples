# Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification Using Computer Vision & IoT
## Intel AI DevJam Demo GUI

![Intel AI DevJam Demo GUI](../IDC-Classifier/Inception/images/IDC-Classification.jpg)

## Abstract

The **Intel AI DevJam Demo** project provides the source codes and tutorials for setting up the project that will demonstrated at **Intel AI DevJam** at **ICML** (**International Conference on Machine Learning**) in **Sweden**, July 2018.

The **IntelÂ® AI DevJam Demo GUI** uses a **Windows application** to communicate with a **facial recognition classifier** and a classifier trained to detect **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (Breast cancer)** in **histology images**.

The goal of this project is to intentionally try to trick the model by using very similar, but opposite class, images from a small set of testing data that I believe humans may have difficulty telling apart. A larger set of testing data is also provided to compare how the model works on larger datasets. 

## IoT Connectivity

**IoT connectivity** for the project is provided by the [IoT JumpWay](https://www.iotjumpway.tech "IoT JumpWay"). The **IoT JumpWay** is an **IoT communication** platform as a service (PaaS) with a social network frontend. IoT JumpWay developers will soon be able to share projects/photos/videos and events. Use of the IoT JumpWay is completely free, you can find out more on the [Developer Program](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com/developers/ "Developer Program") page.

## Checklist

Make sure you have completed the following steps before continuing to configure the Universal Windows Application as you will need them to be waiting for queries or commands before you can complete this tutorial. 

- Setup the [IDC classification server/API](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier "IDC classification server/API").

- Setup the [IoT alarm device](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/Dev-Kit-IoT-Alarm "IoT alarm device").

## Software Requirements

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ "Microsoft Visual Studio 2017")

## Setting Up The Universal Windows Application

![IDC Classifier Universal Windows Application](images/VS2017-Universal-Windows-App.jpg)

You should have already downloaded the repository source code when you completed the [IDC classification server/API](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier "IDC classification server/API") setup. Navigate to **IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC** and double click the **IDC-Classifier-GUI.sln** file to open the solution in **Visual Studio 2017**.

You need the application to connect to the server you setup while following the **IDC Classifier** tutorial. Inside the [IDC classification GUI Classes folder](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier-GUI/Classes "IDC classification GUI Classes folder") you will find a file called [GlobalData.cs](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier-GUI/Classes "GlobalData.cs"), in here you will find settings that you can use to connect to your IDC Classifier Server. When you start your IDC Classifier Server, the output will show you the IP/FQD and port number.

```
class GlobalData
{
    public string protocol = "http://";
    public string ip = "YOUR SERVER IP";
    public int port = 8080;
    public string endpoint = "/api/TASS/infer";
    public string endpointIDC = "/api/IDC/infer";
    public string dataFolder = "Data\\1";
    //public string dataFolder = "Data\\2";

    public double threshold = 0.80;
    public int expectedCount = 6;
}
```

## Testing Data

Inside the GUI project folder you will find a folder called **Data** and inside there 2 folders of data **1** & **2**. Currently the 1st folder has 12 specifically chosen **unseen histology images**. The images chosen were examples that I believed to be very similar to examples in the opposite class. The purpose of chosing these images was to see how the network reacts with very similar but opposite class images. You can flip between the two different size datasets, 1 & 2, or point to your own in the **dataFolder** setting in **Classes/GlobalData.cs**

To add your own data you can remove the images in the **Data** folder and add your own dataset to the folder. Once you have added them to the folder you need to remove any unused images from the directory inside of Visual Studio and then add the new images into the project by right clicking on the **Data** folder, clicking add, and then selecting your new dataset. 

## Testing The Universal Windows Application

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/permissions.jpg)

For this to work it is neccessary for you to have added your photo to the [Known Data](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier/data/known "Known Data") folder of the [IDC Classifier](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier "IDC Classifier") folder. 

Run the app and as the app starts up it will ask you for camera and microphone permissions (microphone is currently unused at this stage in development). Once you accept the permissions the camera should start up and display on the screen. 

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/camera-screen.jpg)

There is a known bug related to this part of the application which uses code from the [Windows Universal Samples: Basic camera app sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/CameraStarterKit "Windows Universal Samples: Basic camera app sample"). You may need to restart the application a number of times before your camera loads. 

Click on the camera button on the right hand side to authenticate yourself. The application will take a photo of you and send it to the server for classification. You should now be authenticated onto the system, to add other people that have permissions to use the use the system simply add their photo to the known data folder in the IDC Classifier.

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/slides.jpg)

Click on the **Classify All Images** button to begin the classification process. The application will loop through the data and send it to the server for the classification. As each image is processed the application will notify you using voice, once the application finishes it will notify you of positive identifications, 

## Inception V3 Results

These results are from using the [AI DevJam Inception V3 IDC Classifier](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier/Inception "AI DevJam Inception V3 IDC Classifier"). As mentioned the images were purposely chosen to challenge the model on false negatives and positives. Ideally there would be 0 of either, but the best case scenario with misclassification is false positives, as it would be better to incorrectly predict non cancerous as cancercerous than it would be to predict cancerous as non cancerous.

The application has been set up to detect if a test classification is correct by checking for a string in file name to compare against the prediction. In this applications case, it will check negative predictions to see if the string **class0** exists in the file name, and for positive predictions it will check for **class1**, this felps to determine whether they are false negatives or false positives.

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/Output-12-Images.jpg)

The logs can be viewed in the output can be viewed in the output area of Visual Studio. Here it will display the info of each image processed, the prediction and whether it is false positive/false negative or correct/incorrect, or whether the classifier is unsure due to a low confidence. What I hoped not see, but expected to see, was false negatives as I had chosen a testing dataset that I believed would possibly trick the classification model. 

The console logs of my testing below show that the IDC Classifier identified 4 of the positive examples as negative, although the confidence was low for 3 of these predictions between 0.726 & 0.807.

The application will classify the image as unsure if it is a positive or negative classification but has a confidence lower than the **threshold** set in **Classes/GlobalData.cs**.  

## False Negatives

```

## Unsure

By detecting whether the classifier is **unsure** or not, we can remove some data that can be further investigated. In this example, if it is a **negative** or **positive** classification, but the confidence is lower than the threshold, it will remove them from calculations and the **unsure** classifications are identified for further investigation. This allowed the application to catch three of the **false negatives** and mark them as **unsure**. 

In a real world example the use of a threshold would make the application more safe. By catching three of the false negatives, we have helped the classifier to separate the **unsure** data.  

The application is able to understand that it is not very confident on some of the images it classified. This is good because the incorrectly classified images were **false negatives**, this means that if we had not caught these, three of the classifications would of shown no cancer when there actually was cancer. 

The application allows a doctor for example, to manually check images that the classifier has classified but is unsure about. 

Below are the **unsure** classifications made by the application using the **Data\\1** **dataFolder** setting in **Classes/GlobalData.cs**:

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/Opposing-Classes.jpg)

You can see the images that were incorrectly classified along with images from opposing classes that I believed may be able to trick the IDC Classifer in the image above. I was able to find similar looking images from the negative class that shows the classifier may of confused two similar images from two seperate classes.

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](../IDC-Classifier/Inception/images/Output-12-Images.jpg)

This was also tested using the [IDC Classifier Test Program](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/blob/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier/Classifier.py "IDC Classifier Test Program") with the same outcome. It seems that similar to facial recognition, Inception V3 gets confused on similar images, this can be confirmed or not by testing larger datasets.

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/will-farrell-chad-smith.jpg)

## Things To Try

- Test on a larger dataset
- Train more similar examples of the misidentified images
- Increase the size of the images from the dataset to 200px x 200px
- Use a different model

## Testing On A Larger DataSet

The second folder located in the **Data** folder can be used to test the classifier on 100 images, 50 negative and 50 positive. These images have been randomly selected and may or may not confuse similar images from seperate classes.

![Testing The Universal Windows Application](images/large-dataset.jpg) 

## Server Settings

You need the application to use the larger IDC test data. You can achieve this by editing the **Classes/GlobalData.cs** file by uncommenting the **Data\\2** folder and commenting out the **Data\\1** folder.

```
class GlobalData
{
    public string protocol = "http://";
    public string ip = "YOUR SERVER IP";
    public int port = 8080;
    public string endpoint = "/api/TASS/infer";
    public string endpointIDC = "/api/IDC/infer";
    //public string dataFolder = "Data\\1";
    public string dataFolder = "Data\\2";

    public double threshold = 0.80;
    public int expectedCount = 50;
}
```

This will start the application using the larger dataset the next time you run the application. The process is the same as when we tested the smaller dataset. Click on the **Classify All Images** button and the program will start to process the images.

## Results

Below you can see the end of the console output from testing using folder **Data\\2** with 50 IDC positive and 50 IDC negative images.
