# Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification Using Computer Vision & IoT
## Intel AI DevJam Demo GUI

![Intel AI DevJam Demo GUI](../IDC-Classifier/images/IDC-Classification.jpg)

## Introduction

The **Intel AI DevJam Demo GUI** project provides the source codes and tutorials for setting up the same project that will demonstrated at **Intel AI DevJam** at **ICML** (**International Conference on Machine Learning**) in **Sweden**, July 2018.

The **Intel® AI DevJam Demo GUI** uses a **Windows application** to communicate with a **facial recognition classifier** and a classifier trained to detect **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (Breast cancer)** in **histology images**.

## IoT Connectivity

**IoT connectivity** for the project is provided by the [IoT JumpWay](https://www.iotjumpway.tech "IoT JumpWay"). The **IoT JumpWay** is an **IoT communication** platform as a service (PaaS) with a social network frontend. IoT JumpWay developers will soon be able to share projects/photos/videos and events. Use of the IoT JumpWay is completely free, you can find out more on the [Developer Program](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com/developers/ "Developer Program") page.

## What Will We Do?

![IDC Classifier Universal Windows Application](images/VS2017-Universal-Windows-App.jpg)

- Setup the [IDC classification server/API](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier "IDC classification server/API").

- Setup the [IoT alarm device](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/Dev-Kit-IoT-Alarm "IoT alarm device").

- Setup the [Universal Windows Application](https://github.com/iotJumpway/IoT-JumpWay-Microsoft-Examples/tree/master/Intel-AI-DevJam-IDC/IDC-Classifier-GUI "Universal Windows Application").
