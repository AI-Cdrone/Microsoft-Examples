## Introduction

This is the classifier tutorial for the **Intel AI DevJam Demo**. The project combines **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification Using Computer Vision & IoT** and **TASS Movidius Facenet Classifier**.

**Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification Using Computer Vision & IoT** combines **Computer Vision** and the **Internet of Things** to provide researchers, doctors and students with a way to train a neural network with labelled breast cancer histology images to detect Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) in unseen/unlabelled images.

The project uses the power of the **Intel速 Movidius** and uses a custom trained **Inception V3 model** to carry out **image classification**, both locally and via a server / client. IoT communication is powered by the [IoT JumpWay](https://iot.techbubbletechnologies.com "IoT JumpWay") and publishes the results after processing local images or images sent through the API.

The **TASS Movidius Facenet Classifier** uses **Siamese Neural Networks** and **Triplet Loss** to classify known and unknown faces. The project uses an UP2 the Intel Movidius and the IoT JumpWay for IoT connectivity.

## Bugs/Issues

Please feel free to create issues for bugs and general issues you come across whilst using this or any other Intel速 related IoT JumpWay issues. You may also use the issues area to ask for general help whilst using the IoT JumpWay in your IoT projects.
